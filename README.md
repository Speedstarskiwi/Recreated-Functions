# Recreated-Functions

Recreated Roblox Inlined Functions compatiable with most execution methods.

Roblox killed a lot of addresses and strings, which developers had to recreate the function.

Since **Luau** was open source, it made it for developers easy to recreate functions.

**Please** do credit me if you used any of these or partially any of these functions.
